						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>The purpose of the TACO Project is to help make the world a better place. How is that for a goal? And now you ask how do we plan to accomplish such a large task? Do it bit by bit, we say. By taking ideas the ideas of countless individuals, and helping to make those ideas a reality, we can conquer challenge after challenge. No barrier can stand in our way!</p>

						<h2>How It Will Be Done</h2>
						<p>With lots of help from everyone! Especially scientists and professionals. By creating a community of people with great ideas and people with the skills and resources to understand how to make those ideas reality, we can make ideas into just that.</p>

						<h2>The Details</h2>
						<p>Or in modern terminoligy, 'deets.' By creating a site that can link people together, give them a space to collaborate, and help them along in any other way we can, any idea can become a reality and help the world, in a fraction of the time and frustration it would normally take. That means that more ideas can become more of a reality! All the technology exists to do this, and so do all the people. It has just taken a little while to glue everything together in such a way that it works.</p>

						<h2>The Barriers</h2>
						<p>Do not worry, they aren't as bad as they sound. And with a bit of help, we can knock them down before we even reach them. The first problem we have is gathering the resources and support for our project. As you can guess, it takes a lot of time, effort, and resources to build any website, and much much more for a website like this one. But not to fear! All you must do is tell all your friends, family, sworn enemies, and anyone else about the TACO Project and how it can benefit their world. We even added small buttons that allow you to share the TACO Project with anyone you want.</p>
